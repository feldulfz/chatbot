# Build Your Own AI Chat App with Claude Sonnet 4 & Angular

Ever wanted to create a chat application that's smarter than ChatGPT's web interface? In this video, I'll show you exactly how to integrate Claude Sonnet 4 directly into an Angular application with custom context that makes it incredibly powerful for your specific use case.

Here's the thing - most AI chatbots don't know anything about YOUR application, YOUR users, or YOUR specific business logic. But what if we could create a chat interface that not only leverages Claude's advanced reasoning but also understands the context of our application? That's exactly what we're building today.
